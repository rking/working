= Working

Whoa!! â˜ˆking's opinionated rig for Ruby dev.

== Basic Idea

- Opinionatedly uses MiniTest for everything. It makes better in-memory structures than RSpec, and is therefore better for the goals of https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/pry-de
- 1:1 mapping between stuff in `lib/` or `app/` and the `test/` dirs.
- Guard for test running (`bundle exec guard`)
- Spork in effect for faster runs

And then execute:

    bundle
    working-init # this tinkers with several files (verbosely)

== TODO

Explain the parts.
